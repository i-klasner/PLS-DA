Testing the effects of measurement error or PCA, PCR, and PLSDA.

Datasets with generated measurement error were created for the iris data on Sepal Length 
and Petal Length. Gamma values of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 were used to control the noise-to-signal
ratios, and each was replicated 100 times. The PCA model was created and performance
evaluated by computing specificity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy.
Petal Length with gamma of 0 had greater variance than Sepal Length, therefore measurement
error had a greater effect on Petal Length.
This was replicated for homogeneous and heterogeneous errors. Performance decreased with 
increasing gamma values. Performance was slightly higher with heterogeneous variance.

This was replicated for Height and Weight of the bodyfat data using PCR. Models were evaluated
Mean Squared Error and Adjusted R^2. The number of principle components was selected by:
the percentage rule, Kaiser rule, slope cutoff, and RMSEP. Performance indicated by 
MSE increased with increasing gamma.  Weight with gamma=0 had greater variance, but
measurement error had a greater effect on Height (indicated by R^2).
This was replicated for homogeneous and heterogeneous errors. Performance decreased with increasing
gammas. Performance was higher for homogeneous variance.
